# ICECREAM-REVENUE-PREDICTION

Project Description: Predicting Ice Cream Business Revenue Using Temperature

Objective:
The project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the revenue of an ice cream business based on temperature. By analyzing historical data, the project seeks to create a reliable linear regression model to forecast future revenues. This model enables ice cream businesses to optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and marketing campaigns, particularly during seasonal demand changes driven by temperature variations.

Applications:
 -Sales Strategy Optimization: Helps businesses plan sales efforts based on temperature forecasts.
 -Inventory Management: Ensures optimal stock levels during peak demand periods.
 -Marketing Efforts: Guides targeted advertising based on seasonal demand patterns.
 
 This project provides a foundational understanding of how external factors like temperature can influence business performance and showcases the utility of predictive 
 modeling in decision-making.
